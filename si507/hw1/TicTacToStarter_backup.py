# FUNCTIONS
def player_name(player_id):
    '''return the name of a player with a specified ID

    Parameters
    ----------
    player_id: int
        player's id, which is an index into PLAYER_NAMES

    Returns
    -------
    string
        the player's name

    board layout:
    1 | 2 | 3
    4 | 5 | 6
    7 | 8 | 9

    Numbers are replaced by players' names once they move. 
    Iterate through the board and choose the right thing
    to display for each cell.

    Parameters
    ----------
    board: list
        the playing board

    Returns

    '''allows a player to make a move in the game

    displays who's move it is (X or O)
    prompts the user to enter a number 1-9
    validates input, repeats until valid input is entered

    ----------
    player: int
        the id of the player to move (1 = X, 2 = O)

# TODO: write code to display the correct winner. 
# NOTE: where you implement this (in the while loop or outside it) is up to you to decide,

# NOTE: You may also find it helpful to display the board one final time to make sure 
# you are correctly identifying the winner, but you will not be graded on that.
