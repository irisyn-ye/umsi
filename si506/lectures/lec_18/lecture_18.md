<br />

## Data

[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) provides an
[Article Search API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/overview)
(Application Programming Interface) that permits keyword searching and retrieval of JSON
representations of NY Times articles.

The file `nyt-articles-20221031.json` contains metadata about 300 articles published by the Science
news desk under the general subject "Psychology and Psychologists".

<br />

## 1.0 JSON

[JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data
interchange format for exchanging information between systems.

JSON consists of two basic data structures and several value types.

<br />

## 1.1 JSON data structures

1. An _unordered_ set of name-value pairs known as an _object_ and denoted by curly braces (`{}`).
2. An _ordered_ list of values known as an _array_ and denoted by square brackets (`[]`).

<br />

## 1.2 JSON value types

1. string
2. number
3. boolean
4. array `[]`
5. object `{}`
6. null

<br />

## 1.3 JSON example

Below is an example JSON representation of a NYT article that can be found in the
`nyt-articles-20221031.json` file.

:bulb: Certain name-value pairs have been removed from the JSON document below in the interests of
brevity. For instance only the top 3 keywords (out of 10) have been included in the example.

```json
{
  "abstract": "Ten years ago, psychologists proposed that a wide range of people would suffer anxiety and grief over climate. Skepticism about that idea is gone.",
  "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/health/climate-anxiety-therapy.html",
  "source": "The New York Times",
  "headline": {
    "main": "Climate Change Enters the Therapy Room",
    "kicker": null,
    "content_kicker": null,

  },
  "keywords": [
    {
      "name": "subject",
      "value": "Anxiety and Stress",
      "rank": 1,

    },
    {
      "name": "subject",
      "value": "Psychology and Psychologists",
      "rank": 2,
      "major": "N"
    },
    {
      "name": "subject",
      "value": "Global Warming",
      "rank": 3,
      "major": "N"
    }
  ],

        "title": null,
        "role": "reported",
        "organization": "",

}
```

## 2.0 `json` module

Like the `csv` module the Python standard libary's `json` module provides enhanced functionality for
working with JSON files. JSON is a lightweight data interchange format for exchanging information
between systems.

To use the `json` module you must import it:

```python
import json
```

There are four `json` module functions; two of which are of particular interest to us:

| Function | Purpose |
| :------- | :------ |
| __`json.load()`__ | _Deserializes_ (decodes) a text or binary file that contains a JSON document to a `dict` or `list`. |
| __`json.dump()`__ | _Serializes_ (encodes) an object as a JSON formatted stream to be stored in a file. |
| `json.loads()` | _Deserializes_ (decodes) a string, bytes, or bytearray containing a JSON document to a `dict` or `list`. |
| `json.dumps()` | _Serializes_ (encodes) an object to a JSON formatted string. |

Since you will also be working with JSON documents between now and the end of the semester
implmenting a function that can read a JSON document as well one that can write a JSON document to
a file will prove useful.

<br />

## 2.1 Reading JSON files (`json_load()`)

The function `read_json()` reads a JSON document per the provided filepath, calls the json module's
`json.load()` function in order to _decode_ the file data as a `dict` or a `list` (of dictionaries),
before returning the decoded data to the caller.

```python
def read_json(filepath, encoding='utf-8'):
    """Reads a JSON document, decodes the file content, and returns a list or dictionary if
    provided with a valid filepath.

    Parameters:
        filepath (str): path to file
        encoding (str): name of encoding used to decode the file

    Returns:
        dict/list: dict or list representations of the decoded JSON document
    """

    with open(filepath, 'r', encoding=encoding) as file_obj:
        return json.load(file_obj)
```

<br />

## 2.2 Writing to a JSON file (`json_dump()`)

The function `write_json()` accepts a dictionary or a list of dictionaries, calls the json module's
`json.dump()` function in order to _encode_ the passed in data as JSON before writing the encoded
data to the target file.

```python
def write_json(filepath, data, encoding='utf-8', ensure_ascii=False, indent=2):
    """Serializes object as JSON. Writes content to the provided filepath.

    Parameters:
        filepath (str): the path to the file
        data (dict)/(list): the data to be encoded as JSON and written to the file
        encoding (str): name of encoding used to encode the file
        ensure_ascii (str): if False non-ASCII characters are printed as is; otherwise
                            non-ASCII characters are escaped.
        indent (int): number of "pretty printed" indention spaces applied to encoded JSON

    Returns:
        None
    """

    with open(filepath, 'w', encoding=encoding) as file_obj:
        json.dump(data, file_obj, ensure_ascii=ensure_ascii, indent=indent)
```

<br />

## Challenge 01

__Task__: Read in the NY Times JSON article, extract articles written in 2022, and write the
articles that meet the filter condition to a file as JSON.

1. In `main` call the function `read_json` and provide it with the filepath
   `nyt-articles-20221031.json` in order to retrieve NY Times Science Desk articles filtered on the
   subject "Psychology and Psychologists". Assign the return value to a variable named `articles`.

2. Loop over `articles` and in the loop block write an `if` statement that identifies
   articles with a publication year of 2022. Append each 2022 article to a list (name your choice).

   :bulb: Review the JSON file `nyt-article-example.json` for the appropriate publication date
   name-value pair in order to derive the dictionary key name to use in your `if` statement.

   :exclamation: Each article contains an [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date
   formatted string as the following example illustrates:

   ```commandline
   2022-02-06T10:00:12+0000
   ```

   :bulb: In your `if` statement utilize a `str` method to access the year portion (i.e., "2022") of
   the string. Alternative approaches could involve use of the `datetime` module or the third-party
   library [`dateutil`](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), but these are out-of-scope for
   this challenge.

3. After exiting the loop, call the function `write_json` and write the "accumulator" list encoded
   as JSON to a file named `stu-nyt-articles-2022.json`.

<br />

## 3.0 Nested loops

A nested loop refers to a loop located within the code block of another loop. During each
iteration of the "outer" loop, the "inner" loop will execute, completing all its iterations (unless
terminated early) _prior_ to the outer loop commencing its next iteration, if any.

```commandline
for < element > in < sequence >:
    # indented block
    for < element > in < element (itself a sequence) >
        < statement A >
        < statement B >
        ...
```

The following example illustrates the concept. Loop over the nested lists and print the result of
summing the list elements multipled by each individual element.

```python
nums = [
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
        [100, 200, 300, 400, 500],
        [1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000]
    ]

    for i in nums:
        for j in i:
            print(sum(i) * j) # sum the list element then multiply by each element
```

Returning to the NYT articles, what if you were asked to identify articles in the `articles` list
that possess one or more keywords? Note, that each JSON document representing a NY Times article
contains a list of keyword objects. For example a 2018 article by Paula Span entitled
["Dementia Is Getting Some Very Public Faces"](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/health/alzheimers-dementia-celebrities.html)
includes the following "keywords" JSON list:

```json
"keywords": [
  {"name": "subject", "value": "Alzheimer's Disease", "rank": 1, "major": "N"},
  {"name": "subject", "value": "Elderly", "rank": 2, "major": "N"},
  {"name": "subject", "value": "Dementia", "rank": 3, "major": "N"},
  {"name": "subject", "value": "Psychology and Psychologists", "rank": 4, "major": "N"},
  {"name": "subject", "value": "Disabilities", "rank": 5, "major": "N"},
  {"name": "subject", "value": "Celebrities", "rank": 6, "major": "N"},
  {"name": "persons", "value": "O'Connor, Sandra Day", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}
]
```

If you needed to return articles in the `articles` list that where tagged with either "Dementia"
and/or "Alzheimer's Disease" you could write a function that performs a keyword
look up (e.g., `has_keywords(keywords, filters)` and then call it from inside a `for` loop
in order to identify dementia-related articles. Alternatively, we could implement a
nested loop.

:exclamation: The data set contains five (`5`) keyword "name" values: "subject", "glocations",
"organizations", "persons", and "creative_works" so filtering on "subject" is required.

```python
# Get all articles touching on Dementia
dementia = []
for article in articles:
    for keyword in article['keywords']:
        if keyword['name'] == 'subject' and keyword['value'] in ("Alzheimer's Disease", 'Dementia'):
            dementia.append(article)
            break # avoid appending duplicates due to either/or membership check

# Write to file
write_json('stu-nyt-dementia-articles.json', dementia_articles)
```

In the example above, the outer loop iterates over the `articles` list. The inner loop iterates over
each article's "keywords" list. If the keyword is a subject keyword and the keyword value is either
"Alzheimer's Disease" or "Dementia" a match is obtained and the article is appended to the list
`dementia_articles`. Note the use of the `break` statement inside the inner loop. Since an article
can contain both keyword objects it is imperative that no additional loop iterations occur after the
first match is obtained in order to avoid duplicate append operations.

:bulb: # [Dementia](https://www.alzheimers.gov/alzheimers-dementias/what-is-dementia) is a generic
term that covers a range of neurological conditions impacting the brain including Alzheimer's
Disease.

<br />

## 3.1 Challenge 02

__Task__: Return a dictionary of _unique_ keyword values grouped by the first character of each
keyword and write the results to a JSON file.

1. In `main`, create an empty `dict` named `subjects`.

2. Implement a nested loop that iterates over each article's "keywords" list (i.e., loop over the
   articles and for each article loop over its keywords).

   ```python
   {
       'abstract": '...',
       ...,
       'keywords': [
           {
               'name': 'subject',
               'value': 'Anxiety and Stress',
               ...,
           },
           ...
       ],
       ...
   }
   ```

3. Inside the nested loop block, write an `if` statement that encompasses the following two
   conditions:

   1. The keyword dictionary's "name" value equals "subject"
   2. The keyword dictionary's "value" is not a member of `subjects`

4. If _both_ conditions return `True` create two variables inside the `if` block and assign them the
   following values:

   1. `key`: access the __first character__ of the "value" string and assign a __capitalized__
      version of it to `key`.

   2. `val`: assign the "value" string to `val`.

5. While inside the `if` block assign key-value pairs to the `subjects` dictionary. Each key-value
   pair must be structured as follows:

   ```python
   # '1st character of "value" capitalized': [ < value_01 >, < value_02 >, ...]
   {'A': ['Anatomy and Physiology', 'Advertising and Marketing', ...]}
   ```
   Implement the following filtering "rules" with an `if-else` statement:

   1. Add a new key-value pair _if and only if_ the key does not exist among the `subjects`
      dictionary's keys.

     :exclamation: When adding a new key-value pair assign a list comprising _a single element_
     (`val`) to the new key as the value.

   2. If the key exists among the `subjects` dictionary's keys, append `val` to the list value but
      only if the string assigned to `val` has not been added previously. In other words, no
      duplicates permitted.

6. After exiting the loop uncomment the `write_json` function and run your file. Confirm that the
   JSON file `stu-nyt-subjects.json` was written to your current working directory.

7. BONUS. Uncomment the "Sort keys" dictionary comprehension and the accompanying call to the function
   `write_json()` and run your file again. Confirm that the JSON file `stu-nyt-subjects_sorted.json`
   was written to your current working directory.

<br />

## 3.2 Challenge 03

__Task__: Create a dictionary that links individual articles to the keyword subjects assigned to
each by the NYT staff. You will create two sets of nested loops, one outer nested loop and one inner
nested loop (four loops in total).

1. In `main`, create an empty `dict` named `subject_articles`.

2. Implement a nested loop:

   * Loop I (outer): iterate over the `subjects` dictionary's key-value pairs
   * Loop II (inside loop I): iterate over the "subject" elements in the value (a `list`)

3. Inside the "subject" inner loop implement another nest loop:

   * Loop III (inside loop II): iterate over the the `articles` list of article dictionaries
   * Loop IV (inside loop III): iterate over each article's "keywords" list (as you did in the
     previous challenge)

4. Insert __between__ loop III and loop IV a dictionary named `story` comprising the following
   key-value pairs:

   * headline_main
   * web_url
   * pub_date

   Access the current article and assign its main headline, web URL, and publication date values to
   the appropriate `story` keys. You will assign this "thin" version of the article dictionary to
   `subject_articles`.

5. In the innermost "keywords" loop write an `if` statement evaluates the return value of the
   function named `has_subject`. Pass the current "keyword" value (a `dict`), the string "subject"
   and the loop II "subject" loop variable.

6. Inside the `if` statement, implement the same `if-else` logic utilized in the previous challenge
   to populate the "accumulator" dictionary `subject_articles`. Below is the structure of the
   key-value pairs that you must add to `subject_articles`:

   ```python
   {'< Loop two subject >': [< story_01 >, < story_02 >, ...]}
   ```

   The `if-else` logic must determine whether or not the current "subject" value is a key among the
   `subject_article` keys and either create a new key-value pair or append the current `story`
   dictionary to a matching key's list value.

   The goal is to populate `subject_articles` with key-value pairs such as the example below:

   ```python
   'Artificial Intelligence': [
    {
      'headline_main': 'Something Bothering You? Tell It to Woebot.',
      'web_url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/health/artificial-intelligence-therapy-woebot.html',
      'pub_date': '2021-06-01T06:00:11+0000'
    },
    {
      'headline_main': 'Need a Hypothesis? This A.I. Has One',
      'web_url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/science/artificial-intelligence-ai-psychology.html',
      'pub_date': '2020-11-24T13:47:01+0000'
    },
    {
      'headline_main': 'Why Stanford Researchers Tried to Create a â€˜Gaydarâ€™ Machine',
      'web_url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/science/stanford-sexual-orientation-study.html',
      'pub_date': '2017-10-09T16:44:15+0000'
    }
  ],
  ```

7. After exiting the loop uncomment the `write_json` function and run your file. Confirm that the
   JSON file `stu-nyt-subject_articles.json` was written to your current working directory.

8. BONUS. Uncomment the "Sort keys" dictionary comprehension and the accompanying call to the function
   `write_json()` and run your file again. Confirm that the JSON file
   `stu-nyt-subjects_articles_sorted.json`was written to your current working directory.
