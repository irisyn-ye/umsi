## Vocabulary

* __JSON__. [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight
  data interchange format for exchanging information between systems.
* __Nested Loop__. A `for` or `while` loop located within the code block of another loop.

<br />

## Data

[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) provides an
[Article Search API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/overview)
(Application Programming Interface) that permits keyword searching and retrieval of JSON
representations of NY Times articles.

Today's data comprises a list of 300+ JSON objects that represent the most recent NY Times articles
published by the [Science](https://www.nytimes.com/section/science) Desk that report on scientific
research findings.

An example JSON document named `nyt-article-research-example.json` is included in today's lecture files. You
should review it and familiarize yourself with its structure and name-value pairs.

:bulb: Certain name-value pairs have been removed from the JSON documents in the interests of
brevity. In addition, a "person" object containing all `null` values has also been removed in order
to eliminate the need to introduce exception handling in your code.

<br />

## 1.0 Nested loop challenges

## 1.1 Challenge 01

__Task__: Provide article keyword subject counts employing a nested `for` loop and a helper function
named `get_article_subjects`. Write the counts to a JSON file.

1. Implement the function named `get_subject_keywords`. The function defines a single parameter
   named `article` and returns a list of keyword "subject" string values contained in an article's
   "keywords" list. Review the function's docstring regarding its expected behavior, parameters, and
   return value.

   :bulb: This function implements one of two nested loops that need to located inside the
   `articles` loop.

   __Function requirements and hints__

   1. The list that you return to the caller _must_ include only keyword "value" strings accessed
      from keyword dictionaries with a "name" value that equals "subject".

   2. You should also ensure that no duplicates of the keyword subject's "value" are appended to the
      local accumulator list.

   :bulb: Tuesday's lecture includes code similar to what you should implement in the function block.

2. After implementing `get_subject_keywords()` return to `main`.

3. Call the function `read_json()` and provide it with the filepath argument
   `'./nyt-articles-research-20221102.json'` to retrieve NYT Science Desk "Research" articles.
   Assign the return value to a variable named `articles`.

4. Create an empty accumulator dictionary named `keyword_counts`.

5. Loop over `articles` and for each article encountered call the function `get_subject_keywords()`
   passing it the appropriate argument. Assign the return value to a variable named `keywords`
   (inside the outer loop).

6. Next, implement a _nested_ inner loop that iterates over `keywords`. Check if the "keyword"
   (a `str`) is used as a key in the `keyword_counts` dictionary. If the key is _not_ found in the
   `dict_keys` object add a _new_ key-value pair assigning the keyword element as the key and `1`
   as the value. Otherwise, _increment_ the matching key-value pair by `1`.

7. After exiting the outer loop __uncomment__ the provided dictionary comprehension in order to
   return a new dictionary named `subject_counts` with key-value pairs sorted by value (descending
   order) and then by key (alphanumeric, ascending order).

8. Uncomment the `write_json()` function call and write `subject_counts` encoded as JSON to a file
   named `stu-nyt-subject_counts.json`. Review your file output.

<br />

## 1.2 Challenge 02

__Task__: Everybody loves dinosaurs. Extract articles tagged with the keywords: Dinosaurs, Fossils,
Paleontology, or Pterosaurs and write the articles to a CSV file.

1. In `main()` create an empty accumulator list named `paleontology`.

2. Loop over `articles` and retrieve each article's subject keywords by calling the function
   `get_subject_keywords()`. Assign the return value to a variable named `keywords`.

3. Next, implement a _nested_ inner loop that iterates over `keywords`. If the keyword string
   matches __any__ of the following keyword subjects:

   * Dinosaurs
   * Fossils
   * Paleontology
   * Pterosaurs

   <br />

   append a dictionary to `paleontology` that contains the following "article" key-value pairs:

   1. headline_main (main headline value)
   2. byline (author's original byline value)
   3. web_url
   4. pub_date

   <br />

   :bulb: Review the `nyt-article-research-example.json` file's key-value pairs. I also recommend
   that you pass a dictionary literal to the `list.append()` method.

4. In order to avoid appending duplicate dictionary representations of each article
   employ the appropriate __control statement__ inside the `if` block to terminate the inner
   `keywords` loop whenever an article's subject keyword matches _any_ of the keyword subjects
   listed above.

5. Call the function `write_dicts_to_csv()` and pass it the filepath
   `stu-nyt-paleontology.csv`, the paleontology list, and the keys from one of the list's
   dictionaries to serve as the CSV's header row. Review your file output.

<br />

## 1.3 Challenge 03

__Task__: Extract a list of all authors filtering out duplicate entries. Then write the list of
authors to a CSV file.

1. Implement the function named `get_author_name`. The function defines a single parameter
   named `author` and returns a three-item tuple comprising the person's last name, first name, and
   middle name (if provided). Review the function's docstring regarding its expected behavior,
   parameters, and return value.

   __Function requirements and hints__

   1. Access and return the following article "person" key-value pairs in the following order:

     1. lastname
     2. firstname
     3. middlename

   2. Implement the function with a single line of code.

2. After implementing `get_author_name()` return to `main()`.

3. Create an empty accumulator list named `authors`.

4. Loop over the `articles` list. Implement a nested loop by looping over the "person" list
   stored in the article's "byline" dictionary.

   :bulb: Employ subscript operator chaining in your loop to access the byline "person" list.

5. Inside the inner loop call `get_author_name()` and pass it a "author" dictionary as the argument.
   Assign the return value (a `tuple`) to a variable named `name`.

6. Then check whether or not the `name` tuple is a member of the `authors` list. If the `name` tuple
   is _not_ a list element append it to `authors`.

   :bulb: Sequences of the same type support comparison by position. Corresponding elements/items
   in each sequence are compared _lexicographically_ as described in the Python
   [value comparisons](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#value-comparisons)
   documentation:

   <br />

   > Lexicographical comparison between built-in collections works as follows:
   >
   > For two collections to compare equal, they must be of the same type, have the same length, and
   each pair of corresponding elements must compare equal (for example, [1, 2] == (1, 2) is false
   because the type is not the same).
   >
   > Collections that support order comparison are ordered the same as their first unequal elements
   (for example, [1, 2, x] <= [1, 2, y] has the same value as x <= y). If a corresponding element does
   not exist, the shorter collection is ordered first (for example, [1, 2] < [1, 2, 3] is true).

   <br />

   __Tuple comparison__

   ```commandline
   >>> name01 = ('Brody', 'Jane', 'E.')
   >>> name02 = ('Brody', 'Jane', 'E.')
   >>> name01 == name02
   True

   >>> name03 = ('Angier', 'Natalie', None)
   >>> name01 == name03
   False
   ```

   <br />

7. After exiting the outer loop __uncomment__ the "Sort Authors" variable assignment (i.e.,
   `authors = [...]`). The new list is created using a list comprehension, the built-in `sorted()`
   function, and an anonymous `lambda` function to sort the list by last name, then first name, and,
   lastly, by the middle name.

   :bulb: Most author records do not include a middle name value. Since sorting on `None` triggers
   a runtime `TypeError` exception, I replace each `None` encountered with a blank string (`''`) by
   passing the expression `x[2] or ''` to the built-in `str` function in my `lambda` expression.
   Since `None` is "falsy" the blank string is returned.

8. Call the function `write_csv` and write `authors` to a file named `stu-nyt-authors.csv`. Also
   pass in a `headers` argument comprising a sequence containing the strings "last_name",
   "first_name", and "middle_name". Review your file output.

<br />

## 1.4 Challenge 04

__Task__: Group articles by author and write the data to a JSON file.

1. In `main` create an empty accumulator dictionary named `citations`.

2. Loop over the `articles` list. Implement a nested loop by looping over the byline "person" list
   stored in the article's "byline" dictionary in the same way as the previous challenge.

3. Inside the inner loop call `get_author_name()` and pass it the "author" dictionary as the argument.
   Assign the return value (a `tuple`) to a variable named `name`.

4. In the inner loop block, employ conditional statements to create a key composed of the `name`
   items formatted per the following rules:

   1. If the person possesses a "middlename" value include it in the string you build.

      ```commandline
      '< lastname >, < firstname > < middlename >'  <-- 'Andrews, Robin George'
      ```

   2. Otherwise, if no "middlename" is provided (i.e., the value equals `None`) exclude it from
      the string you build.

      ```commandline
      '< lastname >, < firstname >'  <-- 'Anthes, Emily'
      ```

   3. Assign the string to a variable named `key`.

5. After the `key` assignment, create a dictionary named `story` that contains the following article
   key-value pairs:

   1. pub_date
   2. headline_main (main headline value)
   3. web_url

   :bulb: Review the `nyt-article-research-example.json` file's key-value pairs.

6. Check if the `key` you created can be found among the keys in the accumulator `citations` dictionary. If the
   `key` is _not_ found in the `dict_keys` object add a _new_ key-value pair assigning `key` as the
   key and a list containing `story` as the value. Otherwise, append `story` to the list assigned to
   the matching key-value pair.

7. Uncomment the function `write_json` and write `citations` encoded as JSON to a file named
   `stu-nyt-citations.json`.

<br />

## 1.5 Challenge 05

__Task__: An NYT staff writer is duplicated in the `citations` list due to a missing middle name or
["double-barrelled"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-barrelled_name) name. Combine the
citations and then delete the redundant key-value pair.

1. The NYT staff writer [Roni Caryn Rabin](https://www.nytimes.com/by/roni-caryn-rabin) is listed
   in `stu-nyt-citations.json` both as "Rabin, Roni Caryn" and "Rabin, Roni".

   ```json
   "Rabin, Roni": [
     {
       "pub_date": "2022-08-30T17:24:44+0000",
       "headline_main": "Paxlovid Cuts Covid Deaths Among Older People, Israeli Study Finds",
       "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/30/health/paxlovid-efficacy-seniors.html"
     }
   ]
   ```

2. Access the `citations` list "Rabin, Roni Caryn" key-value pair and _insert_ the single
   "Rabin, Roni" citation (a `dict`) into the "Rabin, Roni Caryn" list in the second (2nd) position.

3. After inserting the dictionary __remove__ the "Rabin, Roni" key-value pair from `citations` by
   passing the dictionary as an argument to the appropriate
   [built-in function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html).

4. Uncomment the `write_json()` function call and write the mutated `citations` list encoded as
   JSON to a file named `stu-nyt-citations-corrected.json`. Review your file output.
