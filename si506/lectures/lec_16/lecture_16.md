## Vocabulary

* __Dictionary__. An associative array or a map, wherein each specified value is associated with or
  mapped to a defined key that is used to access the value.

<br />

## 1.0 The dictionary

Lists and tuples are robust data structures but one downside that they both share is that neither
provides explicit hints as regards the meaning of each element or item.

```python
site = [
    527,
    'Cultural',
    'Kyiv: Saint-Sophia Cathedral and Related Monastic Buildings, Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra',
    'Designed to rival Hagia Sophia in Constantinople . . . .',
    1990,
    0,
    30.51686,
    50.45258,
    28.52,
    'Europe and North America',
    'Ukraine',
    'UKR'
    ]
```

While a few of the elements in the above list are likely comprehensible, discerning the
meaning of the other elements may require "insider" knowledge or an accompanying data dictionary.
Such a situation is rarely ideal when working with data.

The Python dictionary (`dict`) provides an alternative data structure for both _describing_ data
and storing values. Python dictionaries (type: `dict`) are considered _associative arrays_, wherein
each specified value is associated with or mapped to a defined key that is used to access the value.

The beauty of the dictionary is the ability to identify data values by a label or key, usually
rendered as a readable string though not always (integers and tuples are also used as keys). In
other words, you can embed meaning into a data structure.

:bulb: You'll often hear people refer to dictionaries as unordered sets of _key-value pairs_.
However, since Python 3.7 dictionary order is now guaranteed to be the insertion order of its
key-value pairs.

Dictionaries are defined by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of  key-value pairs within curly
braces (`{}`).

```python
{
    < key >: < value >,
    < key >: < value >,
    ...
}
```

Each key-value pair is separated by a colon (`:`). Each value specified is
referenced by its associated key rather than by its numercial position within the dictionary.

Below is a simple dictionary representation of Kyiv's ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ two UNESCO World Heritage sites: Saint-Sophia
Cathedral and Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra (Monastery of the Caves):

```python
site = {
    'id_no': 527,
    'category': 'Cultural',
    'name_en': 'Kyiv: Saint-Sophia Cathedral and Related Monastic Buildings, Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra',
    'short_description_en': 'Designed to rival Hagia Sophia in Constantinople . . . .',
    'date_inscribed': 1990,
    'endangered': 0,
    'longitude': 30.51686,
    'latitude': 50.45258,
    'area_hectares': 28.52,
    'region_en': 'Europe and North America',
    'states_name_en': 'Ukraine',
    'undp_code': 'UKR'
    }
```

:bulb: Python dictionary objects are _iterables_ with a length or size that can be accessed by
calling the built-in function `len()`.

:bulb: A dictionary can also be provisioned with a _composite_ key, that is, a key comprising two or
more values. The composite key must be _hashable_, that is, it must never change during its
lifetime. Tuples that contain hashable values can be employed as a dictionary key as the following
example illustrates

```python
# Tuple (< longitude >, < latitude >)
location = {
    (30.51686, 50.45258): 'Kyiv: Saint-Sophia Cathedral and Related Monastic Buildings, Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra'
}
```

You can check if an object is hashable by passing it to the built-in `hash()` function. Both
strings and tuples possess a hash value; lists and dictionaries do not.

```python
# Tuple is hashable
hash_value = hash((30.51686, 50.45258)) # -4047005574466108915

# List is not hashable
hash_value = hash([30.51686, 50.45258]) # TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```

<br />

## 2.0 Creating a dictionary

There are several ways to create a dictionary.

## 2.1 Assign an empty dictionary to a variable

You can create a dictionary by assigning an empty dictionary to a variable and
then adding key-value pairs one at a time to the dictionary using the subscript operator (`[]`).

:bulb: note the nested dictionary assigned to the key `geo_coordinates`.

```python
site = {}
site['id_no'] = 1330
site['category'] = 'Cultural'
site['name_en'] = 'Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans'
site['short_description_en'] = '[R]epresents a masterful synergy of architectural styles built by Czech architect Josef Hlavka from 1864 to 1882. . . .'
site['date_inscribed'] = 2011
site['endangered'] = 0
site['geo_coordinates'] = {} # nested dict
site['geo_coordinates']['longitude'] = 25.9247222222
site['geo_coordinates']['latitude'] = 48.2966666667
site['area_hectares'] = 8.0
site['region_en'] = 'Europe and North America'
site['states_name_en'] = 'Ukraine'
site['undp_code'] = 'UKR'
```

<br  />

## 2.2 Dictionary literal

You can create a dictionary by defining a dictionary _literal_ and assigning
keys and values separated by a colon (`:`).

```python
site = {
    'id_no': 865,
    'category': 'Cultural',
    'name_en': "L'viv â€“ the Ensemble of the Historic Centre",
    'short_description_en': "The city of L'viv, founded in the late Middle Ages, was a flourishing administrative, religious and commercial centre for several centuries. The medieval urban topography has been preserved virtually intact . . . .",
    'date_inscribed': 1998,
    'endangered': 0,
    'geo_coordinates': {
        'longitude': 24.03198,
        'latitude': 49.84163
        },
    'area_hectares': 120.0,
    'region_en': 'Europe and North America',
    'states_name_en': 'Ukraine',
    'undp_code': 'UKR',
    }
```

<br />

## 2.3 Built-in `dict()` function

You can also call the built-in `dict()` function to define a dictionary. You can pass in a sequence
of keyword arguments separated by commas or pass in a sequence of tuples.

```python
# Pass in keyword arguments (note use of nested dict())
site = dict(
    id_no=1411,
    category='Cultural',
    name_en='Ancient City of Tauric Chersonese and its Chora',
    short_description_en='The site features the remains of a city founded by Dorian Greeks in the 5th century BC on the northern shores of the Black Sea. . . .',
    date_inscribed=2013,
    endangered=0,
    geo_coordinates=dict(longitude=33.4913888889, latitude=44.6108333333),
    area_hectares=259.3752,
    region_en='Europe and North America',
    states_name_en='Ukraine',
    undp_code='UKR'
    )

# Pass in tuples (note used of nested dict())
site = dict(
    [
        ('id_no', 1411),
        ('category', 'Cultural'),
        ('name_en', 'Ancient City of Tauric Chersonese and its Chora'),
        ('short_description_en', 'The site features the remains of a city founded by Dorian Greeks in the 5th century BC on the northern shores of the Black Sea. . . .'),
        ('date_inscribed', 2013),
        ('endangered', 0),
        ('geo_coordinates', dict([('longitude', 33.4913888889), ('latitude', 44.6108333333)])),
        ('area_hectares', 259.3752),
        ('region_en', 'Europe and North America'),
        ('states_name_en', 'Ukraine'),
        ('undp_code', 'UKR')
        ]
    )
```

<br />

## 3.0 Working with dictionaries

Dictionaries, like lists, are mutable and capable of modification. Utilize the subscript operator
`[]` and a key value to interact with a dictionary and its individual key-value pairs.

<br />

## 3.1 Accessing a value

A dictionary value is accessed by its associated key using the subscript operator.

```python
site = {
        'id_no': 527,
        'category': 'Cultural',
        'name_en': 'Kyiv: Saint-Sophia Cathedral and Related Monastic Buildings, Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra',
        'short_description_en': 'Designed to rival Hagia Sophia in Constantinople . . . .',
        'date_inscribed': 1990,
        'endangered': 0,
        'geo_coordinates': {
            'longitude': 24.03198,
            'latitude': 49.84163
            },
        'area_hectares': 28.52,
        'region_en': 'Europe and North America',
        'states_name_en': 'Ukraine',
        'undp_code': 'UKR'
        }

    # Accessing a value
    site_name = site['name_en']
```

:exclamation: If you attempt to access a dictionary value with a non-existent key you will trigger
a `KeyError` exception.

```python
site_name = site['name'] # raises KeyError: 'name'
```

<br />

## 3.2 Accessing a "nested" value

Besides strings, numbers, and booleans, dictionaries can reference more complex data
structures such as lists, tuples, and other dictionaries. This is often referred to as "nesting".

To access nested values you can "chain" the subscript operator `[]` by providing each bracket with
appropriate the key, index, or slice as determined by the type of nested object.

```python
# Accessing a nested dictionary value
site_latitude = site['geo_coordinates']['latitude']
```

<br />

## 3.3 Add a key-value pair

You can add a _new_ key-value pair to an _existing_ dictionary by assigning a new value to the
dictionary using the subscript operator (`[]`) and specifying a key.

```python
# Add key-value pair
site['subregion_en'] = 'Eastern Europe'
```

The new key-value pair is appended to the dictionary's key-value pair sequence.

The above approaches holds true for nested objects as well. Use subscript chaining to reference
the relevant key-value pair.

```python
# Add nested key-value pairs
  site['street_address'] = {}
  site['street_address']['Saint-Sophia Cathedral'] = 'Volodymyrska St, 24, Kyiv, Ukraine, 01001'
  site['street_address']['Kyiv Pechersk Lavra'] = 'Lavrska St, 15, Kyiv, Ukraine, 01015'
```

<br />

## 3.4 Modify an existing value

If you need to _modify_ an existing value you can assign a new value by referencing the
relevant key:

```python
# Modify existing key-value pair
site['endangered'] = 1
```

<br />

## 3.5 Delete a key-value pair

If you need to delete a key-value pair you can use the built-in `del()` function.

```python
# Delete key-value pair
del(site['undp_code'])
```

<br />

## 4.0 Select dictionary methods

The Dictionary object is provisioned with several useful
[methods](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_dictionary.asp) of which the following are
relevant to today's discussion:

* `dict.get()`
* `dict.keys()`
* `dict.values()`
* `dict.items()`

<br />

## 4.1 `dict.get()` method

You can guard against `KeyError` runtime exceptions by accessing dictionary values using
the `dict.get()` method.

```python
dict.get(< key >[, < default value >])
```

The `dict.get()` method defines two parameters: a key and an optional default value to return if
the passed in key has no associated value. If a default value is not specified, the optional
default value defaults to `None`. This behavior prevents `dict.get()` from triggering a `KeyError`
if a non-existent key is passed to it.

```python
site_type = site.get('category') # returns str

# TODO Uncomment
# site_type = site['type'] # triggers KeyError

site_type = site.get('type') # returns None

site_type = site.get('type', 'Undefined') # returns default value
```

<br />

## 4.2 `dict.keys()` method

You can retrieve all the keys in a dictionary by calling `dict.keys()`. The method returns a
`dict_keys` object, an object that provides a _view_ or a pointer to the dictionary's keys. While
you can loop over a `dict_keys` object you _cannot_ modify either the referenced keys or the
associated dictionary.

:bulb: you can create a copy of the `dict_keys` object using the built-in `list()` function. Passing
the `dict_keys` object to `list()` will return a list of keys. Doing so simplifies working with the
keys.

The following Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ dictionary comprising basic country data compiled by the
[United Nations](https://data.un.org/en/iso/ua.html) illustrates basic use of the `dict.keys()`
method.

```python
country = {
    'name': 'Ukraine',
    'region': 'Eastern Europe',
    'population': 43467000,
    'urban_population_pct': 69.5,
    'surface_area_km2': 603500,
    'capital_city': 'Kyiv',
    'un_membership_date': '1945-10-24'
}

# Loop over dict_keys object
for key in country.keys():
    print(key)

# Convert dict_keys to a list
country_keys = list(country.keys())

# Loop over list of keys; print associated values
for key in country_keys:
    print(country[key])
```

<br />

## 4.3 `dict.values()` method

You can retrieve all the values in a dictionary by calling `dict.values()`. The method returns a
`dict_values` object, an object that provides a _view_ or a pointer to the dictionary's values. While
you can loop over a `dict_values` object you _cannot_ modify either the referenced values or the
associated dictionary.

:bulb: you can create a copy of the `dict_values` object using the built-in `list()` function. Passing
the `dict_values` object to `list()` will return a list of values. Doing so simplifies working with the
values.

```python
# Loop over dict_values object
for value in country.values():
    print(value)

# Convert to a list
country_values = list(country.values()) # convert to a list

# Print value types
for value in country.values():
    print(type(value))
```

:bulb: You can also unpack a dictionary's values. Recall the Heritage site's `geo_coordinates`
is a dictionary comprising the site's latitude and longitude. The values can be unpacked and
assigned to variables.

```python
# Unpacking
site_longitude, site_latitude = site['geo_coordinates'].values()

print(f"\n4.3.5 Site Geo coordinates = {site_longitude}, {site_latitude}")
```

<br />

## 4.4 `dict.items()` method

You can loop over a dictionary's keys _and_ values by calling the `dict.items()` method.
`dict.items()` returns a `dict_items` object, a list-like object composed of key-value tuples. Call
`dict.items()` whenever you need to filter on specific keys in order to access a subset of the
dictionary's values.

```python
# Looping over a dictionary's items
for key, val in country.items():
    print(f"key: {key}, val: {val}")
```

<br />

## Challenge 01

__Task__: Convert the `country` dictionary's numeric values that are masquerading as strings to
either an integer or a float.

1. In the `main` function block, loop over the `country` dictionary's items (keys and values) and
   utilize conditional logic to convert the following string values to either `int` or `float`:

   | Key | Convert value to |
   | :-- | :--------------- |
   | 'population' | `int` |
   | 'surface_area_km2' | `int` |
   | 'urban_population_pct' | `float` |

2. Uncomment the `print()` and `pp.pprint()` functions to check your output.

<br />

## Challenge 02

__Task__: Call the two utility functions that utilize the `csv.DictReader` and `csv.DictWriter`
objects to convert CSV rows to dictionaries and dictionaries to CSV rows.

:bulb: We will discuss these functions and the `csv.DictReader` and `csv.DictWriter` objects in more
detail during the next lecture.

1. In the `main` function block, call the function `read_csv_to_dicts` and pass it the filepath
   `'./whc-sites-2022.csv'` as the lone argument. Assign the return value to a variable named
   `sites`.

   :bulb: The `sites` list contains 1155 dictionaries.

2. Create an empty accumulator list and assign it to a variable named `ukrainian_sites`. Loop over
   the `sites` list and in the loop block write a conditional statement that identifies Ukrainian
   World Heritage sites employing one of the following key-value pairs in your `if` statement:

   | Key | Value |
   | :-- | :--------------- |
   | 'states_name_en' | 'Ukraine' |
   | 'undp_code' | `ukr` |

3. If the `if` statement evaluates to `True` append the dictionary to the `ukraine_sites` list.

4. After exiting the loop access the first dictionary in the `ukraine_sites` list and call its
   `.keys()` method. Assign the return value, a "view" object of the dictionary's keys, to a
   variable named `fieldnames`.

5. Call the function `write_dicts_to_csv` and pass it the following arguments in the specified
   order:

     1. `'whc-sites-ukraine-2022.csv'`
     2. `ukrainian_sites`
     3. `fieldnames`

   Confirm that the new CSV file was created in your lecture directory.
