## Vocabulary

* __Docstring__. String literal that appears as the first statement in a function, class, or
  module. The docstring provides a terse description of an object's purpose, attributes, and
  behavior. The docstring is assigned to an object's __doc__ attribute and is available via
  introspection.
* __File Object__. An object that provides a file-oriented application programming interface
  (API) to a either a text file, binary file (e.g., image file), or a buffered binary file. File
  objects include read and write methods for interacting with a file stored locally or remotely.
* __Flow of execution__. The order in which statements in a program are executed. Also referred to
   as _control flow_.
* __UTF-8__. [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) is a variable-width character encoding
  that uses one to four one-byte (8-bit) code units to represent individual characters. The encoding
  encompases the older US-ASCII character set as well nearly all Latin-script alphabets as well as
  IPA extensions, Greek, Cyrillic, Coptic, Armenian, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, Thaana, N'Ko alphabets
  and most Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters. UTF-8 is the dominant encoding used on the Web.

<br />

## Lecture Data

* __resnick-citations.csv__. A comma-separated values (CSV) delimited text file containing
  biblometric data (e.g., citation report) of Professor Paul Resnick's articles, book chapters,
  and conference papers. Data sourced from the
  [Web of Science](https://search.lib.umich.edu/databases/record/10165?query=web+of+science)
  database and exported into [Endnote](https://endnote.com/). Beyond illustrating this week's topic
  on reading from/writing to files, the data set also helps illustrate UMSI scholarly output,
  scholarly connections within UMSI (e.g., UMSI co-authors) as well as scholarly â€œinfluence"
  (citation counts).
* __umsi-faculty.csv__. List of UMSI faculty (last name, first name).

<br />

## 1.0 Absolute paths

A path points to a specific location in a hierarchical file system. File paths are either _absolute_
or _relative_.

An __absolute path__ includes the root element (i.e., `/`, `C:`) and the directory list
(delimited by either a forward `/` (macOS/*nix or a backwords slash `\` (Windows)) required to reach
the target directory or file.

<br />

### Absolute file path

```python
# macOS/*nix
path = '/Users/arwhyte/Documents/umich/courses/SI506/lectures/lecture_14/lecture_14.py'

# Windows (Git Bash)
path = '/c/Users/arwhyte/Documents/umich/courses/SI506/lectures/lecture_14/lecture_14.py'

# Windows (Command Prompt)
path = 'C:\Users\arwhyte\Documents\umich\courses\SI506\lectures\lecture_14\lecture_14.py'
```

A __relative path__ is defined in relation to the current working directory (cwd). Given the
absolute paths above the relative path `lectures/lecture_14` or `./lectures/lecture_14` implies
that the current working directory is either `/Users/arwhyte/Documents/umich/courses/SI506/lectures`
(macOS/*nix) or `/c/Users/arwhyte/Documents/umich/courses/SI506/lectures/` (Windows Git Bash).

One drawback to using absolute paths is that they are generally __not portable__ between operating
systems and file systems. With rare exceptions, the absolute paths listed above would trigger a
runtime `FileNotFoundError` exception if included in Python `*.py` file shared with you.

:exclamation: Avoid submitting assignments to Gradescope that include _hard-coded_ filepath strings.
An absolute path included in your `*.py` file that is appropriate for your local file system is
guaranteed to trigger a runtime `FileNotFoundError` exception when encountered by Gradescope. In
other words, your machine's macOS or Windows file system absolute paths do not match the absolute
paths required for Gradescope's Linux environment (or a classmate's laptop file system). In other
words, absolute paths are rarely if ever portable between file systems.

<br />

## 1.1 `pathlib.path` module

As might be expected the Python standard library includes modules to deal with these challenges. The
`pathlib.path` module provides an object-oriented approach to creating and managing paths. The
`pathlib` module included in your Python 3.x download is designed to work with your operating system
(OS) so no special configuration is required for it to recognize and work OS-specific file system
paths.

Like the `csv` module you must import `pathlib.path` module to use it. Once imported you instantiate
(i.e., create) an instance of the `Path` class and then access its methods and other attributes. In
the example below a `Path` instance's `cwd()` method is called to return the current working
directory path.

```python
from pathlib import Path

cwd = Path.cwd() # method call
```

You can also call the `Path` instance's `resolve()` and `absolute()` methods to construct an
absolute path to this `*.py` file's parent directory:

:bulb: the "dunder" `__file__` attribute is assigned to the module that is currently being imported
(e.g.,  `lecture_14.py` file).

```python
parent_path = Path(__file__).resolve().parent

# OR

parent_path = Path().absolute()

# OR

parent_path = Path().resolve()
```

As hinted above, you can leverage the "dunder" `__file__` attribute when instantiating `Path()` to
retrieve the absolute path of a target file such as `lecture_14.py`:

```python
abs_path = Path(__file__).absolute()

# OR

abs_path = Path(__file__).resolve()

# OR

abs_path = Path('lecture_14.py').resolve()
```

You can construct paths by calling the `joinpath()` method:

```python
parent_path = Path(__file__).resolve().parent # parent directory

faculty_path = parent_path.joinpath('umsi-faculty.csv')
resnick_path = parent_path.joinpath('resnick-citations.csv')
```

And you can retrieve segments from a path:

```python
print('\n1.2.5 Path parts',
   f"\nname = {resnick_path.name}",
   f"\nstem = {resnick_path.stem}",
   f"\nsuffix = {resnick_path.suffix}",
   f"\nparent dir = {resnick_path.parent}",
   f"\nparent.parent dir = {resnick_path.parent.parent}"
   )
```

There is much more to `pathlib.path` than returning absolute paths. For more information on using
the module see this week's recommended readings.

<br />

## 1.2 Using `os.path` to create paths

The standard library's `os.path` module includes a number of useful functions for constructing
pathnames out of strings. Like `pathlib.path` you get the `os.path` module designed for
the operating system Python 3.x is expected to run on (e.g., macOS, Windows 10).

```python
# Current working directory
os_cwd = os.getcwd()

# Absolute path to directory in which *.py is located.
os_parent_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

# Construct macOS and Windows friendly paths
os_faculty_path = os.path.join(os_parent_path, 'umsi-faculty.csv')
os_resnick_path = os.path.join(os_parent_path, 'resnick-citations.csv')
```

<br />

## 2.0 Error handling

The Resnick publication/citation data contains a variety of numbers masquerading as strings.
However, given the number of list elements looping over the data and attempting to determine which
elements to convert to type `int` appears problematic.

Python's `try` and `except` statements can help reduce the complexity of the challenge. The idea
behind the statements is to _try_ and perform an operation inside the `try` statement block and if
the action triggers a runtime exception allow the accompanying `except` statement to _catch_ the
exception before it terminates execution and perform one or more operations in response.

The strategy is to handle errors _after_ they are encountered rather than before, an approach
known by the acronym __EAFP__ (i.e., easier to ask forgiveness than permission).

The function `convert_to_int` illustrates how to leverage `try` and `except` statements to keep a
program/script running despite encountering a runtime exception (in this case a `ValueError`) if
a value is passed to the function that cannot be converted to an integer by the built-in `int()`
function.

```python
def convert_to_int(value):
    """Attempts to convert a string, number or boolean value to an int. If
    a runtime ValueError exception is encountered, the function returns the
    value unchanged.

    Parameters:
        value (str|bool): string or boolean value to be converted

    Returns:
        int: if value successfully converted else returns value unchanged
    """

    try:
        return int(value)
    except ValueError:
        return value
```

When a `value` is passed to `convert_to_int` the Python interpreter will attempt to execute the
`try` clause. Should the `try` block result in an exception, the interpreter will proceed
directly to the `except` clause and execute its statement block, thus avoiding the termination of
the program's execution due to an exception (such as a `ValueError`).

An `except` clause may specify a specific exception type or multiple exceptions expressed as a
parenthesized tuple:

```python
except ValueError:
   ...
```

```python
except (AttributeError, TypeError, ValueError):
      ...
```

Also a `try` statement may be accompanied by more than one `except` clause in order to specify
different handlers for different exceptions. An `else` clause can be added after the `except`
statement(s) in order to include code that _must_ be executed if the `try` statement block does
not raise an exception.

:exclamation: If an exception occurs that does not match the specified exception(s) named in the
`except` clause an _unhandled_ exception is triggered and code execution will cease as a result.

<br />

## 2.1 `try` and `except` statements in action

The `resnick-citations.csv` will be read in by the `read_csv` function as a nested list. In order to
convert strings to integers in each nested publication list we will need to either call the
function `convert_to_int` from inside a nested loop (a future topic) or pair the function with
another function that allows us to traverse each publication's elements. The function `clean_data`
is designed to handles that task.

```python
def clean_data(publication):
    """Mutates the passed in < publication > list by converting numbers masquerading as
    strings to an integer (int).

    Checks each string element in the < publication > list. Delegates to the function
    < convert_to_int > the task of attempting to convert the target string to an integer.
    Strings that cannot be converted are returned unchanged.

    Parameters:
      publication (list): represents a publication

    Returns:
        list: mutated publication list
    """

    for i in range(len(publication)):
        publication[i] = convert_to_int(publication[i])
    return publication
```

The program/script work flow is managed by the `main` function. Converting certain publication
strings to integers will require the following steps:

1. Read in the Resnick publications/citation data.

2. Loop over the publications. Given that each "publication" element is itself a mutable list
   a `for` loop can be employed to engage with each element.

3. Call the function `clean_data` during each loop iteration passing it the current publication
   (a `list`) as the required argument.

   1. `clean_data` will loop over the passed in publication's elements. For each element encountered
   the function will call `convert_to_int` in an attempt to convert the string to an integer.

   1. `convert_to_int` will attempt to convert the value to an integer. If the passed in element
   triggers a runtime `ValueError` exception the function will catch the exception and return the
   element unchanged; otherwise it will return an integer after passing the element to the built-in
   `int()` function.

4. Assign the return value to back to the current element.

If all goes well each mutated publication element will resemble the following list:

```python
['Recommender systems', 'Resnick, Paul; Varian, HR', '', 'COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM', 'MAR 1997',
1997, 40, 3, '', '', '', 56, 58, '', '10.1145/245108.245121', '', '', 1552, '64.67', 0, 0, 3, 4,
16, 24, 19, 24, 34, 49, 52, 38, 73, 79, 91, 82, 80, 83, 87, 107, 126, 132, 112, 113, 91, 33]
```

<br />

## 3.0 Challenges

Today's challenges focus on implementing functions and reading from and writing to CSV files.

__`resnick-citations.csv` "headers" row__

```python
citation_headers = [
    'Title', 'Authors', 'Book Editors', 'Source Title', 'Publication Date', 'Publication Year',
    'Volume', 'Issue', 'Part Number', 'Supplement', 'Special Issue', 'Beginning Page',
    'Ending Page', 'Article Number', 'DOI', 'Conference Title', 'Conference Date', 'Total Citations',
    'Average per Year', '1995', '1996', '1997', '1998', '1999', '2000', '2001', '2002', '2003',
    '2004', '2005', '2006', '2007', '2008', '2009', '2010', '2011', '2012', '2013', '2014', '2015',
    '2016', '2017', '2018', '2019', '2020'
    ]
```

__`umsi-faculty.csv` "headers" row__

```python
faculty_headers = ['last_name', 'first_name']
```

<br />

## Challenge 01

__Task__. Implement a function that permits retrieval of any publication element
using the CSV "headers" row as an index value lookup mechanism.

1. Implement the function `get_attribute`. Review the docstring to better understand
   the function's expected behavior. You can then employ the function to return any single
   publication attribute (e.g., Title, Publication Year, Total Citations) by leveraging the CSV's
   "headers" row of column names to look up the element's index value.

   :bulb: The function can be implemented with one line of code.

2. After implementing `get_attribute` return to the `main` function. The "Average per Year" value of
   each publication remains a string that could be converted to a float. Loop over the `publications`
   list, call `get_attribute` to retrieve the "Average per Year" value for each publication. Assign
   to a local variable (name your choice).

3. Call the function `convert_to_float` passing to it the value to be converted. Assign the return
   value to the current publication's "Average per Year" element.

   :bulb: Utilize `headers` to look up the "Average per Year" index value so that you can assign the
   float value to the correct element.

4. Uncomment `print()` and check your work.

<br />

## Challenge 02

__Task__: Return list of UMSI-coauthored publications. Write the results to a file.

1. Replace the `pass` statement in the function `has_umsi_faculty_author` with compound conditional
   statement that implements the following conditions:

   1. The local `name` value must not equal the passed in or default `ignore` value
      (e.g., Paul Resnick).
   2. The local `name` value is a member of the `coauthors` list.
   3. If a match is obtained return `True`.

   Review the docstring to better understand the function's expected behavior.

2. After fixing `has_umsi_faculty_author` return to the `main` function. Create an empty
   "accumulator" list named `umsi_coauthored_publications`. The list will hold UMSI
   faculty-coauthored publications.

3. Loop over the publications list accessing each publication's authors. In the loop block call the
   function `get_attribute` to retrieve the publication's "Authors" and assign the return value to
   a variable (name your choice).

4. Write an `if` statement in the loop block that calls the function `has_umsi_faculty_author` and
   passes to it as arguments `umsi_faculty` (a slice), and `authors`. If the expression evaluates
   to `True` append the publication to the "accumulator" list.

5. Call the function `write_csv` and write the updated `umsi_coauthored_publications` list to the
   file `resnick-citations-umsi_coauthored.csv` employing `headers` as the headers argument.

<br />

## Challenge 03

__Task__: The data set includes columns that provide an annual count of the number of citations
garnered by each publication for the period 1995-2020. However, the total citation count per year
is not provided and must be calculated. Implement a function that computes the total citation count
across all publications for a given year.

:bulb: You can leverage the `headers` element and slicing to return a list of all years that the
data set covers. Then loop over the list and for each year sum the citation count for each
publication.

1. Return a slice of `headers` that includes all year elements ('1995'-'2000'). Assign the list to
   a variable named `years`.

   :bulb: Look up the index value for the `headers` element `1995` and use it as the start value in
   your slicing notation.

2. Implement the function `get_citation_count_by_year`. Review the docstring to better understand
   the function's expected behavior.

3. After implementing `get_citation_count_by_year` return to the `main` function. Loop over the
   `years` list and in the loop block call the function `get_citation_count_by_year` passing to it
   the `publications` list, `headers`, and the current year value. Assign the return
   value to a local variable of your own choosing (e.g., `count`).

4. Append the annual citation count to the accumulator list `annual_counts` in the form of a
   two-item tuple comprising the year and total citations count for the year.

   ```python
   [
       (< year >, < total citations >),
       (< year >, < total citations >),
       . . .
   ]
   ```

5. After exiting the loop call the function `write_csv` and write the `annual_counts` list to the
   file `resnick-citations-annual_counts.csv`. Since each nested tuple comprises two items pass
   `['year', 'citations']` as the headers argument.

<br />

## Challenge 04 (BONUS)

__Task__: Return the publication(s) with the highest citation count. Write the results to a file.

1. In `main` create two "accumulator" variables: `max_citations` (`list`) and `max_count` (`int`).
  Assign sensible default values.

   You will use the variables to identify the publication(s) with the highest number of
   citations recorded between 1995-2020. If two or more publications tie for the highest number of
   citations, append each to the `max_citations` list.

2. Loop over the publications list and implement conditional statements that compare the current
   publication's "Total Citations" count to the previously recorded `max_count`. In the loop block
   call the function `get_attribute` to retrieve the publication's "Total Citations" count and
   assign the return value to a variable of your own choosing.

   __Requirements__

   1. If the current total citations count is greater than the previous count, _remove_ all
      publications added previously to `max_citations` and then append the current publication to
      the list (the new leader). Set `max_count` to the current total citations count.

   2. If the current count is equal to the previous `max_count` append the publication to
      `max_citations`.

   3. Otherwise, proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

3. After exiting the loop call the function `write_csv` and write the updated `max_citations` list
   to a file named `resnick-citations-max_citations.csv` passing the `headers` list as the `headers`
   argument.

<br />

## Challenge 05 (BONUS)

__Task__: Return the publication(s) with the lowest citation count. Write the results to a file.

1. In `main` create two "accumulator" variables: `min_citations` (`list`) and `min_count` (`int`).
   Assign sensible default values.

   You will use the variables to identify the the publication(s) with the lowest number of
   citations recorded between 1995-2020. If two or more publications tie for the lowest number of
   citations, append each to the `min_citations` list.

2. Loop over the publications list and implement conditional statements that compare the current
   publication's "Total Citations" count to the previously recorded `min_count`. In the loop block
   call the function `get_attribute` to retrieve the publication's "Total Citations" count and
   assign the return value to a variable of your own choosing.

   __Requirements__

   1. If the current total citations count is less than the previous count, _remove_ all
      publications added previously to `min_citations` and then append the current publication to
      the list (the new leader). Set `min_count` to the current total citations count.

   2. If the current count is equal to the previous `min_count` append the publication to
      `min_citations`.

   3. Otherwise, proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

3. After exiting the loop call the function `write_csv` and write the updated `min_citations` list
   to a file named `resnick-citations-min_citations.csv` passing the `headers` list as the `headers`
   argument.
