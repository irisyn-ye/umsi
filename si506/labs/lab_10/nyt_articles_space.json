    "lead_paragraph": "Reaction wheels like the ones that NASA officials say have failed aboard the Kepler spacecraft, effectively ending its mission to detect potentially habitable planets outside the solar system, are simple devices, at least in concept. But making ones that can survive the rigors of a rocket launching and then spin for a long time to keep a spacecraft properly oriented — in Kepler’s case, to keep its telescope precisely pointed at the same field of stars — is difficult.",
