    Each tuple contains a variable assigned to a decoded JSON representing a person (in the 0th index) and
        a boolean indicating their intruder status (True, if intruder; False, if just a passenger) (in the 1st index).

    Utilizes sequence unpacking to access the 'person' element and the 'intruder' status element from
        the passed in list of tuples.
    Utilizes an if-elif-else statement and compound conditionals to evaluate the truth value of the 'intruder'
    status and check the following conditions:
        (1) If the 'intruder' status element evaluates to True and 'intruder' is already a key in the starship dictionary,
            then it simply appends the 'person' to the 'intruder' key-value pair.
        (2) If the 'intruder' status element evaluates to True and 'intruder' is not yet a key in the starship dictionary,
            then it assigns a list literal containing the 'person' to the new 'intruder' key.
        (3) Otherwise, it appends the 'person' to the 'passengers' key.

    Parameters:
        starship (dict): a dictionary representation of the decoded JSON that contains starship attributes.
        people (list): a list of tuples where, for each tuple, a variable assigned to the decoded JSON representing
